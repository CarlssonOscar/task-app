# Testing

It's possible to create a user, otherwise a user is provided below:
User: testuser1 Pass: passowl1

The testing can be found [here](test.md).

# Deployment 

## Create Project

* The project respository was create using Code Institutes Gitpod Full [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

## Insalling Modules

Terminal:

pip3 install:
* django gunicorn
* dj_database_url psycopg2
* dj3-cloudinary-storage

After a requirements file was created.
* pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

## Cerating Project and App

Create Project
* django-admin startproject project-name
python3 manage.py starapp app-name

settings.py:

Add the created app to the installed apps sections.

After this the changes in the repository can be migrated in the terminal:

python3 manage.py migrate

Then one can check if everything was done correctly through running the server.

python3 manage.py runserver
